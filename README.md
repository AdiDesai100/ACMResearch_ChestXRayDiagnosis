<p> Machine learning and artificial intelligence have changed the way we live in today's society. From how we order to food to how we provide health care, these technologies continue to help us surpass the impossible and create new breakthroughs everyday. These innovations have specifically changed the way the current medical system functions to make it more efficient and effective. One prominent region where these new technologies are yielding strong effects is in diagnosis and image recognitions from diagnostic imaging tools. This ability to quickly and accurately detect the minute signs of a disorder from diagnostic imaging is crucial as it can allow for early detections which would lead to best results from a treatment plan.</p>

<p> During the course of this research project, the team will employ CNNs and machine learning methods to develop a model that can accurately detect signs of a disease given an input of a chest xray. </p>
